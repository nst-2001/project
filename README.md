The program is based on simplified customer billing service
In this, each customer record is stored in arrays and can be used for reference.
You will have to enter:
i) number of customers
ii)name 
iii)street
iv)city
v)account number
vi)previous balance
vii)current payment
ix)payment date 

As each customer record is read into the computer,
i) compare the curent payment payment with previous one and update the status of the account
ii)a new balance will be calculated by subtracting the current balance from the previous balance( a negative balance will indicate a credit)
